#🛡️ ShadowGuard: AI-Driven Honeypot System

ShadowGuard is a highly interactive honeypot system developed to trap cyber attackers, analyze their behavior and gather threat intelligence. Unlike traditional static honeypots, it integrates with Large Language Models LLMs to build a unique, dynamic and convincing Virtual File System tailored to each attacker's IP address.

💻 Cross-Platform Support
This project has been updated to support two distinct environments:

Linux Version (Docker/GUI): The original containerized version using Docker and X11 forwarding.

Windows Version (Native CLI): A lightweight, headless Python port designed for Windows or any system without X-Server/XLauncher support.

✨ Key Features
🧠 Dynamic AI Reactions: Uses a local LLM to generate realistic terminal outputs in seconds based on the attacker's commands.

🕵️ Attacker Profiling & Risk Scoring: Instantly analyzes commands, such as wget, cat /etc/shadow, to calculate risk scores and profile the attacker, which range from Bot to Advanced Threat.

🦠 VirusTotal Integration: Automatically queries the VirusTotal API to check if an attacking IP is a known global threat.

📄 Automated Incident Reporting: Generates professional PDF Threat Reports summarizing attacker commands and risk profiles upon system shutdown.

📂 Personalized Virtual Systems: Hashes the attacker's IP to generate a consistent identity seed, presenting a fake corporate profile, such as QuantumFinance Ltd or NexaCloud Systems, complete with fake credentials.

🕸️ Built In Red Team Module: Includes an attacker client, main_cli.py, capable of encoding payloads in Base64 or Hex to test the honeypot's evasion detection.

🏗️ Architecture & Core Components
The system is split into four primary components:

The Honeypot (honeypot_core): The main trap. Opens listening ports, handles incoming socket connections and builds the fake Linux filesystem.

The AI Bridge (app.py): A Flask API that acts as a middleman between the isolated Honeypot and the host machine's LM Studio, ensuring the AI replies strictly as a Linux terminal.

The Monitor (monitor_cli.py): A live UDP listener that displays real-time threat intelligence, logs attacker keystrokes and generates the final PDF report.

The Attacker (main_cli.py): A Red Team testing tool to connect to the honeypot and simulate manual or automated attacks.

🛠️ Installation & Setup
Requirements for BOTH versions:
LM Studio: You need a local AI model running. Go to the "Local Server" tab in LM Studio and start the server at localhost:1234.

VirusTotal API: Open core.py and replace VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY = "VIRUS_TOTAL_API_To_Be_Changed" with your actual API key for full threat intel functionality.

Windows Environment (Native CLI - No UI): 
This version is optimized to run natively without Docker or XLauncher. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.

Install required Python libraries:

PowerShell
pip install flask requests fpdf
Open a terminal and start the Monitor to watch for attacks:

PowerShell
python monitor_cli.py
Open a second terminal to run the Attacker (Red Team) module to test the system:

PowerShell
python main_cli.py
(Note: When you shut down the monitor by pressing Ctrl+C, it will automatically generate a PDF report in the ./data/reports folder)

⚠️ Legal Disclaimer
This project was developed solely for educational purposes, cybersecurity research, and the analysis of defense mechanisms. Because it contains high-interaction features and directly executes AI-generated text, it is not recommended to connect it directly to production networks without adequate isolation. The developers accept no responsibility for any consequences arising from the misuse of this tool.
